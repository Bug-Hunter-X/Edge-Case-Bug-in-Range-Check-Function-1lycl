# Edge Case Bug in Range Check Function

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a JavaScript function designed to check if a number falls within a specified range.  The `checkIfNumberIsWithinRange` function, as initially implemented, fails to correctly handle cases where the input number is exactly equal to the minimum or maximum values of the range. 

The bug is illustrated in the `checkIfNumberIsWithinRangeBug.js` file, while the corrected version is provided in `checkIfNumberIsWithinRangeSolution.js`.  The solution addresses the edge cases to ensure the function behaves as intended.
